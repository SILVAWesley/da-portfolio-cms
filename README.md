## About this project

As a digital artist, it is very important to have a way to show your work in a way that interested people and companies
can get in touch with you. The art pieces that digital artists want to expose might change from time to time. That being said,
it is very handy for them not having to contact someone who knows how to code to do that. Also, as a developer, getting
requests just to add more art pieces, or change content in the page, can get really frustrating. But also developing a platform
to manage content is very complex and it might be more work than actually possible. <br/> <br/>
That's where this **headless Content Management System (CMS)** built with **Strapi** comes into place. It can manage the showcasing arts,
texts and contact informations in the portfolio while offering:

- Internationalization (in english and brazilian portuguese)
- Image storage in an S3 Bucket
- Full CI/CD with Github Actions and Docker ([checkout the deployment workflow file](.github/workflows/deploy.yaml))
- Deployment on the cloud (AWS)
- Easy local development through the [docker-compose file](docker-compose.yml)
- A postgres database managed by Vercel
- Unit tests using Vitest
- ESLint/Prettier as linting and formating tools
- Husky, commitzen and commitlint to help maintaining the patterns
